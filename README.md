# chat-app-android

This is a simple but very powerful Android app that uses socket.io to communicate with the live server.It is live,you can download it to test for yourself.

This app isn't meant to be used for commercial purposes,it's just a demonstration of how socket.io can work in Android.It was inspired with the fact that there aren't any demos that really show how to do so.

The following are the gif(s) of how the app works.
